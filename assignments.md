## Upcoming Assignments

### A1: Hello, World

You’ll complete a series of 3 quick exercises intended to familiarize yourself with JavaScript and its syntax. These exercises are more detailed in the assignment `README`, but they are as follows:

1. Hello World, the classic (1 pt)
2. Alice, meet Bob (2 pt)
3. RGB to CMYK (2 pt)

*You will learn: Git, JavaScript, Variables, Coding style, String interpolation, Console*

### A2: Loops

Using loops, write code that accomplishes the following exercises:

1. Fibonacci, prints the first N fibonacci numbers (3 pt)
2. FizzBuzz, the classic programming prompt (3 pt)
3. Albers, draw the squares (4 pt)

*You will learn: Data manipulation, Conditional logic, Loops, Arrays*

### A3: N-Body (Pair)

Implement an n-body simulation, which keeps track of the movements of the inner planets of our solar system. You’ll be provided an initial set of values and be responsible for updating the position, velocity, and acceleration of the planets using linear approximation.

You may choose to complete this assignment individually or with a partner.

*You will learn: Loops, Arrays, JSON*

### A4: Garden (Pair)

Create a virtual garden which implements the ability to render and place elements where you click your mouse. Inspiration for this assignment is based on the demo for [Put That There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyBEUyEtxQo).

You may choose to complete this assignment individually or with a partner.

*You will learn: DOM and JS Relationship, Functions, Modularizing code, Event listeners*


### A5: Sierpenski (Pair)

Implement a sierpenski triangle which renders in an HTML Canvas by recursively calling itself again and again. A user should be able to specify the level of detail (n) that the triangle renders at.

You may choose to complete this assignment individually or with a partner.

*You will learn: Recursion, Canvas*

## Final Project

More and more, devices around us are clawing for our attention. Content creators around us are capitalizing on our attention, assigning a dollar value to our time. As designers, we must be mindful of how our designs can encourage, discourage, or run parallel to the established conventions of technology and the internet. 

Laurel Schwulst writes, in My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge of the many shapes a website can take. 

Design and develop a piece of software that lets you use the internet mindfully. In your project proposal, succinctly (in 200 words or less) describe the problem you are trying to solve, and your solution for it. You may choose to work with a partner if you would like. 

Following your proposal, you will explore 3 different directions for your design, followed by prototyping one specific direction and user testing it. Once you have gathered feedback, you will then implement an MVP version of your software in code.

Your submitted project should include your final design files (Sketch or Figma), a copy of your user interview notes, and a link to your working website.
