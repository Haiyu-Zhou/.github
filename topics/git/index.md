## What is Git?

Git is a open source free software, created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) (also the inventor of Linux). It allows for for us to create versions of our code as we work on it. It *also* allows us to store our code on both our computers and in the cloud, on a remote server.

GitHub is a platform that makes it easy to host git repositories remotely to access them. This makes it incredibly easy for anyone to access code and to collaborate on software. For example, you can access the codebase for this website, [here](https://github.com/f22-psam3210/.github). In fact, you can even make a copy of it directly to your computer!

To do this, you can either use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), or my preferred way, the command line. Note that if you have a Windows device, you may have to [install git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

Make sure you have a GitHub account before this next step, and sign up with your New School email so you can also get some student benefits!

## Let’s make a repo!

In this brief tutorial, we’ll go over creating a repository, and committing some code to it. We’ll also go over making it accessible using GitHub Pages, the platform’s free web hosting service.

Navigate [here](https://github.com/new). You can also click the `+` button in the top right part of the navigation to create a new respository.

> A repository is a central location for your code to live in. It stores the current state of the code, as well as any previous versions you may want to keep

On this page, set the repository name to something creative or unimaginative, like `example-respository`. Also check `Add a README file`. This will create the repository with a `README` that details the information about the repository. Click **Create Repository**.
