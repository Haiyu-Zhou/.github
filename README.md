## Description
This is a computer science class first, and a design class second. We will focus on fundamentals of computing through the lens of JavaScript and its particulars before diving into the creation of a web based application using Vue. Students will learn about computing paradigms such as objects and arrays, functions, data structures, and algorithms. We will review what a modern JS stack looks like and how to call an API, with the final project being a web app that students will design and build. This is a fast paced course and students are expected to dedicate a good amount of time outside of class to assignments from this class.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
- Understand contemporary paradigms of computer science including arrays, loops, functions, and objects
- Know how to read documentation and learn about new technical topics
- Proficiently read and implement JavaScript as part of their own work 
- Know how to debug code effectively
- Use Vue to build a web-based application

## Community Agreement
To be completed in class.

## Grading and Policies

|Criteria|%|
|---|---|
|Participation |10%|
|Midterm Exam  |15%|
|Final Project |30%|

|Assignment 4  |10%|
|Assignment 5  |10%|

You will be graded on correctness, code quality and style, and creativity. The assignments are structured in a way to give you practical, hands-on experience with the concepts we discuss in lecture and in class. This class will have a programming midterm exam which will evaluate your knowledge of concepts covered in class; the purpose of the exam is not meant to be a "gotcha" and I like to think that if you are paying attention in class, and doing the work, then you should be just fine.

Assignments 1 and 2 are individual assignments, whereas 3, 4 and 5 are pair assignments. Students have the option of working in pairs or alone. If students choose to work as pairs, they will submit one assignment and both students will share the same grade. Assignments will be evaluated based on correctness and code quality.

The final project will follow a traditional design and development lifecycle that one may see in the real world. Students will be expected to define a product, sketch on and user test their designs, and finally build their product as a functioning web app. They will be evaluated on completion, creativity, and quality of work. Like the latter assignments, students may again choose to work with a partner. If they do, then students will share the same grade.

### A Note on Code Plagiarism
You may occasionally find code or similar solutions to assignments online for this course. The copying or adapting of any code beyond the course material (lectures, exercises, demos) without attribution is not allowed under any circumstances. If you do use code from class, please attribute it accordingly. There is zero tolerance for any sort of plagiarism, which ranges from “verbatim copying” (e.g., cutting-and-pasting code) to “thorough paraphrasing” (e.g., changing variable names or rearranging code). 

Any violation of this policy will result in an automatic failure of the course. Refer to the **Academic Honesty and Integrity** part of the CD [program policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u358io8doX_SVVMGqIM_oH5V0OIccneYu4Ww-uE55QM/edit?usp=sharing) for more information. Additional guidelines for including code written by others can be found in MIT’s [student integrity handbook](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code).
