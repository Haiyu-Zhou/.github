## Description
This is a computer science class first, and a design class second. We will focus on fundamentals of computing through the lens of JavaScript and its particulars before diving into the creation of a web based application using Vue. Students will learn about computing paradigms such as objects and arrays, functions, data structures, and algorithms. We will review what a modern JS stack looks like and how to call an API, with the final project being a web app that students will design and build. This is a fast paced course and students are expected to dedicate a good amount of time outside of class to assignments from this class.
